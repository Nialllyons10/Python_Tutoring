Q1.

Last month Mark purchased some software company stocks. Here are the details of
the purchase:
   The number of shares that Mark purchased was 2,000.
   When Mark purchased the stock, he paid $40.00 per share.
   Mark paid his stockbroker a commission that amounted to 3 percent of the
    amount he paid for the stock.

Two weeks later Mark sold the stock. Here are the details of the sale:
   The number of shares that Mark sold was 2,000.
   He sold the stock for $42.75 per share.
   He paid his stockbroker another commission that amounted to 3 percent of
    the amount he received for the stock.
    
Write a program that displays the following information:
   The amount of money Mark paid for the stock.
   The amount of commission Mark paid his broker when he bought the stock.
   The amount that Mark sold the stock for.
   The amount of commission Mark paid his broker when he sold the stock.
   The amount of money that Mark had left when he sold the stock and paid his
    broker (both times). If this amount is positive, then Mark made a profit. If the
    amount is negative, then Mark lost money.

Q2. 

A painting company has determined that for every 112 square feet of wall space, one
gallon of paint and eight hours of labor will be required. The company charges
$35.00 per hour for labor. Write a program that asks the user to enter the square feet
of wall space to be painted and the price of the paint per gallon. The program should
display the following data:

   The number of gallons of paint required
   The hours of labor required
   The cost of the paint
   The labor charges
   The total cost of the paint job

  Q3. 
  
Write a program in functions to process a string.
  1. in main() function, the program asks the user to enter a string and then call
  the following three functions and print their returned values;
  
  2. create count_vowel() function that accepts the input string as an argument
  and returns the number of vowels in the string;
  
  3. create count_consonant() function that accepts the input string as an
  argument and returns the number of consonants in the string;
  
  4. create count_vocabulary() that accepts the input string as an argument and
  returns the total number of unique letters in the string.

Q4. 

Write a program to calculate the working hours and payment in a month using
nested loops. Assume that there are 4 weeks in this month and the user works for 5
days per week. The program should ask the user to type the number (int) of working
hours for each day and then display:

  1. total working hours in this month;
  2. total payment to the user (the payment is $10 per hour).

  Q5. 
  
  Write a program to process a input string such as:
    
      "StopAndSmellTheRosesAndTheLilies"

The outputs should be
  1. The sentence is: ‘Stop and smell the roses and the lilies’;
  2. The sentence contains 6 unique words.
  
Please write the program in functions:

  1. in main() function, the program asks the user to enter a string and then call
  the following three functions and print their returned values;
  
  2. create convert() function that accepts the input string as an argument and
  convert the input string to a sentence in which the words are separated by
  spaces and only the first word starts with an uppercase letter, and finally
  returns the sentence;
  
  3. create count_vocabulary() that accepts the sentence (the result of convert()
  function) as an argument and returns the total number of unique words in the
  sentence.

  Q6. 
  
 In mathematics, the notation n! represents the factorial of the nonnegative integer n .
The factorial of n is the product of all the nonnegative integers from 1 to n. For
example,

  7! = 7 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5,040
  
and

4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24

Write a program that lets the user enter a nonnegative integer and then uses a loop
to calculate the factorial of that number. Display the factorial.

Q7. 

Write a program that accepts a sentence as input and converts each word to “Pig
Latin.” In one version, to convert a word to Pig Latin you remove the first letter and
place that letter at the end of the word. Then you append the string “ay” to the word.

Here is an example:

English: I SLEPT MOST OF THE NIGHT

Pig Latin: IAY LEPTSAY OSTMAY FOAY HETAY IGHTNAY
